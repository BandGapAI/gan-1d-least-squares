# Convergence and Optimality Analysis of Low-Dimensional Generative Adversarial Networks using Error Function Integrals

This is a repository that contains the numerical simulations for the paper
__Convergence and Optimality Analysis of Low-Dimensional Generative Adversarial Networks using Error Function Integrals__.

The code is related to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, the analytical part is described
in paper and not present in the code. We provide a comparison of the computation results.

To run the code, open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter notebook environment. The requirements
are installed at in the first executional cell. You need Python 3.x to run the code.

The resulting graphs for the executed code are shown below.
