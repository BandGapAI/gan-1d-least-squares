# Convergence and Optimality Analysis of Low-Dimensional Generative Adversarial Networks using Error Function Integrals

This is a repository that contains the numerical simulations for the paper
__Convergence and Optimality Analysis of Low-Dimensional Generative Adversarial
Networks using Error Function Integrals__.

The code is related to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, the analytical
part is described in paper and not present in the code. We provide a comparison
of the computation results.

To run the code, open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter notebook environment. The
requirements are installed at in the first executional cell. You need Python
3.x to run the code.

## Visualizations 
The resulting graphs for the executed code are shown below. Extended comments
on them can be found in the article.
